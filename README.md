# ECE-369-Main
 All of the code for the ECE 369 Computer Architechture and Organization class. My group created a fullscale pipelined datapath. For the competition, we created a video processing algorithm in MIPS ISA and executed it on an Xlinix Artix-7 FPGA with the goal of the fastest execution time.
